                    Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 by the United States Congress “for the preservation of…and for the enjoyment of the people". 
                It was the first area of wild land to be devoted for recreational use under government management and since then, has been the model for future national park establishments. 
                Yellowstone is located in the northern part of the Rocky Mountains, in the northwest corner of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and encompasses 2.2 million acres. 
                Today, the national park receives 3 million visitors yearly and has five separate entrances with 370 miles of paved roadway throughout its area.
